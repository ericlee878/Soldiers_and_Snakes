# Soldiers_and_Snakes

## Welcome to Snake Shooter

### Game Objective
You are a brave soldier trapped in a snake-infested battlefield. Your mission is to survive as long as possible by avoiding the deadly snakes and taking them down with your trusty firearm. Earn points for each snake you defeat and see how long you can last!

### Game Elements

#### The Soldier
- **Appearance:** The soldier is a pixelated character, adorned in a black uniform, wielding a gun.
- **Behavior:** The soldier is under player control, capable of omnidirectional movement. The soldier can also discharge bullets to neutralize snakes.
- **Controls:** Navigate with the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right). Fire a bullet in your facing direction with the Spacebar.

#### Snakes
- **Appearance:** The snakes are menacing entities, rendered in red.
- **Behavior:** Snakes emerge from the map's center, immediately pursuing the soldier. Their movement is slow yet relentless. Contact with a snake results in game termination.

#### Bullets
- **Appearance:** Bullets are diminutive, swift projectiles launched by the soldier.
- **Behavior:** Bullets travel linearly in the soldier's orientation, obliterating snakes upon impact.

### Scoring
- **Snake Defeat:** Each vanquished snake adds 2 points to your score.
- **Sound Cue:** A sound chimes whenever you score.

### Game Over

- **Endless Challenge:** The game lacks a definitive end state, aiming instead for the longest possible survival and highest score accumulation.

### Good Luck, Soldier!
Finesse and precision are your lifelines in Snake Shooter. Command the soldier, decimate the snakes, and vie for a top score. But beware â€“ a solitary slip could serve you as a serpent's feast!
