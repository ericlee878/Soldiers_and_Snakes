Welcome to Snake Shooter
Game Objective
You are a brave soldier trapped in a snake-infested battlefield. Your mission is to survive as long as possible by avoiding the deadly snakes and taking them down using your trusty firearm. Earn points for each snake you defeat and see how long you can survive!
Game Elements
The Soldier
•	Appearance: The soldier is a pixelated character, wearing a black uniform and holding a gun.
•	Behavior: The soldier is controlled by the player and can move in all four directions. The soldier can also shoot bullets to eliminate snakes.
•	Controls: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the soldier. Press the Spacebar to shoot a bullet in the direction the soldier is facing.
Snakes
•	Appearance: The snakes are menacing creatures, colored red.
•	Behavior: Snakes spawn in the center of the map and immediately chase after the soldier. They move slowly but persistently. If a snake touches the soldier, the game is over.
Bullets
•	Appearance: Bullets are small, fast-moving objects fired by the soldier.
•	Behavior: Bullets are fired in a straight line in the direction the soldier is facing. They are used to eliminate snakes on contact.
Scoring

•	Every time you score, a sound is played.
Game Over

Good Luck, Soldier!
Your survival in Snake Shooter depends on your agility and sharpshooting skills. Move the soldier, shoot down the snakes, and aim for the highest score. But be cautious – one wrong move, and the snakes will have you for lunch!
